title: "About Me"
---

I’m a maker based in North Wales, and I love working with my hands to create jewellery from local pebbles and slate. I enjoy problem-solving, exploring new materials, and trying different techniques to see what works.

My inspiration comes from the landscape around me, as well as Welsh symbols and archaeological finds. I like taking these materials and ideas and turning them into something wearable, unique, and full of character.

I also enjoy finding and wearing handmade, local jewellery myself, so I know how much care and personality can go into a piece.
