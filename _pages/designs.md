### Designs
The designs I create are inspired by Welsh symbols and archaeological finds, including Roman and early medieval tiles. I try to stay true to the originals, including the small quirks or slightly wonky shapes that give them character. I used reference pictures from the [Amgueddfa Cymru — Museum Wales]((https://museum.wales/) website to guide the designs.

I work with pebbles and slate, each piece chosen for its texture, shape, and colour. The natural variations in the materials make every piece unique, and the enamel I add brings out bold, glossy colours that highlight the design.

Below are some of my favourite designs and the stories behind them.
