The designs I create are inspired by Welsh symbols and archaeological finds, including Roman and early medieval tiles. I try to stay true to the originals, including the small quirks or slightly wonky shapes that give them character. I used reference pictures from the Amgueddfa Cymru — Museum Wales website to guide the designs.

I work with pebbles and slate, each piece chosen for its texture, shape, and colour. The natural variations in the materials make every piece unique, and the enamel I add brings out bold, glossy colours that highlight the design.

Below are some of my favourite designs and the stories behind them.

You can see how each piece comes together and the materials I work with on the Process page.
