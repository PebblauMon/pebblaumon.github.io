title: "The Process"
---
The process starts with selecting the right materials. I collect pebbles from North Wales beaches, taking care to find ones that work well together, and I use slate from old roofs. Each piece of slate is cut into smaller squares, split by hand to make it thinner, and then cut into disks for pendants and earrings. I tumble polish the slate so it has a smooth, pebble-like finish.

The pebbles mostly stay in their natural shape, but I take care when pairing them to get a good match.

Once the stones are prepared, I engrave the designs using a fibre laser. I then add colour by packing enamel into the grooves and firing them in a kiln at 700 degrees over several hours. This gives the designs a glossy, durable finish.

Finally, I assemble the pieces. Pendants get a sterling silver jump ring and chain, while earrings are attached to sterling silver backs.
